= Introduction =

The derby patch has slightly been modified from the implementation used in the original paper because corresponding libraries used in the original version considered inadequate for Apache Derby.

= Details =

  * ConcurrentHashMap is used for _tbl_ field in [http://code.google.com/p/derby-nb/source/browse/trunk/derby-nb/java/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/BufferCache.java#44 BufferCache], instead of [http://high-scale-lib.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/high-scale-lib/high-scale-lib/org/cliffc/high_scale_lib/NonBlockingHashMap.java org.cliffc.high_scale_lib.NonBlockingHashMap]

The patch is thus not completely non-blocking.

  * ArrayBlockingQueue is used for _queue_ field in [http://code.google.com/p/derby-nb/source/browse/trunk/derby-nb/java/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/BackgroundDirtyPageWriter.java#57 BackgroundDirtyPageWriter], instead of [http://code.google.com/p/xbird/source/browse/trunk/xbird-open/main/src/java/xbird/util/concurrent/collections/BoundedTransferQueue.java BoundedTransferQueue]

ArrayBlockingQueue is blocking because it takes a ReadWriteLock on accesses.
BoundedTransferQueue is non-blocking version of a bounded [http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html BlockingQueue].

  * AtomicReferenceArray is used for _pool_ field in [http://code.google.com/p/derby-nb/source/browse/trunk/derby-nb/java/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/GClockBuffer.java#52 GClockBuffer], instead of [http://code.google.com/p/xbird/source/browse/trunk/xbird-open/main/src/java/xbird/util/concurrent/lang/VolatileArray.java VolatileArray]

VolatileArray is more efficient than AtomicReferenceArray, but it uses Unsafe APIs of SUN jdk.
